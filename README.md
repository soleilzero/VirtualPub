#  Unit tests in Java

This is the solution to a project given by my university.
For now, it is more inclined towards setting up the environment than the tests themselves.

## Tools used
* Maven 4.0
* Java
* JUnit 5
* Jacoco 0.8
* SonarQube (pending)
* Jenkins (pending)

## Project
- [X] Compilation with Maven
- [X] Test with JUnit and Jacoco

Now that the test environment works. We have to actually test and correct the code.

### ToDo
- [ ] SonarQube
- [ ] Test and refactor


### Backlog
- [ ] Linter
- [ ] SonarQube
- [ ] Jenkins
- [ ] Site
- [ ] Deployment artifact
